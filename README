Introduction
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"managedFlu" is a C++ library that allows to write interactive functionality on top of 
referenced OpenFOAM API. As it has appeared, OpenFOAM imposes limitations on writing 
corresponding solver code, namely - most OpenFOAM objects should live in the same "scope"
and exactly within the same time (that is why solver expands its functionality by usage 
of "#include" tricks). If one of the objects die unexpectedly, all others can not be used
anymore. Such specific assumptions made by OpenFOAM make it impossible to write a 
functionality which can be used many times in during the same session (something the other
"pythonFlu" package are going to provide to). managedFlu provides a general solution for this
case by introducing an additional "managed" level for the referenced OpenFOAM C++ API. 
All the developers need to do, to be able to write interactive applications, it is to create 
and use corresponding "managed" OpenFOAM objects instead of the referenced ones. For more details 
developers can check corresponding solver examples that comes with managedFlu as a its demonstration.
